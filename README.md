## The GEDI Toolbox

Automatically download, filter, and spatially index the GEDI data.

Features include:
- Download only the data you need: select regions, columns, time periods, and filtering conditions
- Small disk footprint relative to original GEDI data size
- Designed for multiple simultaneous users
- GEDI data is stored in a spatially indexed PostGIS database, allowing straightforward spatial SQL queries
